10,495 out of 992 found this helpful,One of the finest TV series coming from India.,authentic_writer,15 May 2020,"I was hooked to it from the very first episode, the main character is a true representation of the everyday man, flawed yet tenacious. The characters were intricately put together and the pacing was absolutely perfect. This is an absolute gem and it needs to be experienced. Absolutely loved it, cannot wait for Season 2."

Alhawat ji acting was superb and his Haryanvi accent and style ,look Acting and everything was amazing and worth for praising He totally steal the show the on him only.

10,53 out of 102 found this helpful,Rating A+ Not the usual Good versus Evil,ankurchakraborty-83075,19 May 2020,"I'm not much into those series whose seasons or episodes are too long. This one is neither. Well written amazingly executed for a series, this will create a storm on peoples emotions for a lot of reasons. So a lot of people are going to hate this series for this and for other reasons.Best thing about the story is this is not the usual police procedural. Its starts that way about killing a high profile journalist to proving them they are terrorists to getting to conclusion that this was never about the journalist, it was always about the hitman and killing him. And then everything going down the toilet.Jaideep Ahlawat as Inspector Hathiram Chaudhary was so natural. This is his lead role and he was simply superb. He was so flawless and made it look like a simple acting job. His frustrating part which he would sometimes take out on his junior and also apologised to him for being mean. There was a scene where Hathiram kept on kicking one of the suspects who was at first female then turned to be a transgender, as he was taking out his entire life's frustration and anger on one person. He was also shown to be remorseful and apologetic for his behaviour. More he dug into the suspects pasts, it was clear that he wasn't angry or disgusted, he felt pity for them. Though Hathiram's relationship with his wife Renu Chaudhary portrayed by Gul Panag and son wasn't major for the story but it had an impact in defining the character. What i liked most is that his relationship with his father wasn't much explored or it would have deviate form the story.Abhishek Banerjee had 3-4 lines in the entire series. Everyone knows about his acting capabilities shown in Street and Mirzapur. His negative screen presence is extremely gravity defying. Every time he came on i was like, so okay this character is a psychopath, he's going to do something and then he doesn't. Every time he was on screen he left with a cliffhanger, as if you want him to do something. This was Abhishek Banerjee's method acting, doing nothing and watching with dead eyes. There was a specific scene where his character kills three boys with a hammer and he was just sitting there as an animal who just hunted and is tired.I won't say Neeraj Kabi's role as Journalist Sanjeev Mehra was his best. There wasn't much room for improvement or improvisation since its known what Neeraj Kabi is capable of. Even with restrictions he played the role of big time egoistic journalist as best as he could. There are only two moments which had impact on the character. First was when he realised his wife Dolly Mehra portrayed Swastika Mukherjee who had anxiety disorder and was always depending on her husband to calm her down is no longer needed by her since she adopted a stray dog to fill the hole in her life. Second was when Hathiram told him that Sanjeev Mehra was a big guy and he was small but in reality he is just as unimportant as Hathiram and he just looked big. These two were the ego shattering blow to the character.Mairembam Ronaldo Singh as Mary Lyngdoh or Chini and Niharika Lyra Dutt as Sara Matthews was my somewhere in the middle favourite characters. Sara's respect for her hero Sanjeev turned to love to hate since she got to see what he actually is. A big egoistic hypocrite who thinks he owns everything. She ended up resigning after helping Hathiram in his investigation. Chini's biggest character reveal was she wanted money for the operation so that she can marry the person she loved and thats why she was Woking with the criminals.Biggest plus point of the series is not a huge production team was involved. 4 writers, 2 directors, 2 cinematographers and 1 editor. With small teams a huge amount of focus is always on the execution. Story was simply brilliant. A lot of materials were taken from actual events and watching them played out in a drama is just brutal. Social inequalities, sexually abusing children to family disputes to people going to any length to get what they wanted, violence shown in this show especially the one in the school where Tyagi kills 3 students from his school with the hammer and cracks the skull, has never been shown in the Indian entertainment before. I think dogs had a philosophical sense to the show. A yearning to belong or to feel important by others."

10,101 out of 219 found this helpful,Sets A Bench Marks.,alokranjan-34952,15 May 2020,"If a category like ""perfect"" in the Indian web series categories exists, then ""Patal Lok"" must be top in the list.The whole series was like a journey. In which the character Inspector Hathiram Chaudhary was a co-passenger the viewers like me.The series seems to satisfy every type of audience, giving a happy ending with unexpected climaxes.This series has become so good that the writer of this series will continue to have a lot of pressure over the director, producer and all the other participants to bring its counterpart to the next season.This series has set a benchmark.The responsibility has fully played, given to Jaideep Ahlawat.Best wishes to Cast and Crew."
8,143 out of 320 found this helpful,Amazon never disappoints.,djdevansh95,15 May 2020,"Patal Lok , is a new crime drama series. It is produced by Clean Slate Films (Anushka Sharma's production house which is also responsible for Pari & NH10). The creatives heads behind the show are also noteworthy, like Sudip Sharma(Udta Punjab), Navdip Singh(NH10 & Laal Kaptan), Hardik Mehta(Kamyaab), Prosit Roy(Pari). If one does'nt really now about anything about the show, the creative heads are enough to feel hyped.
So the first few words about the show is that, the hype is real real. They delivered something worth your time. The show is about for criminals who are trying to attempt a murder of the most respectable news journalist. Due to anonymously typed by someone they get caught. Somehow the case is thrown by the higher authorities to the the local thana officer (Jaideep Ahlawat). He is so a desperate person for his promotions. Jaideep Ahlawat as a cop delivered his best role. He is so natural, raw, vulnerable, kind, and a person who knows and accept his limits.
The show is a slow and steady burn. It will defiantly take time to sync. That's why it has to have a solid pay off in the end. Man it is worth every second of your time. Go watch it asap!"

8,130 out of 301 found this helpful,Performances makes the Well Written Story more Entertaining. - itsbymayank Review Paatal Lok.,mayanklouteriya,15 May 2020,"One word Review - Raw.
Very well written and directed, Every character has done his job in the best way, the story get distracted just because of unnecessary things but not every time. Slow start but makes it engaging with time, Bit lengthy but ok. Described every character's part/story and it is somewhere necessary to do, that brief thing make story engaging somewhere yes.
The Performance of the lead Jaydeep/Ishwak Singh n Neeraj Kabi and all character's work is flawless, just that they enjoyed and lived the story. The story doesn't revolves around the criminal and crime everytime it has more to show.. Watch Abhishek Banerjee he is gem.
Story is good, Gripping, Real. Worth Watch.

3 star for acting by main charactersDirector looks biased to show one community innocent, it has been shown in series many times. Which make the story telling very awkward. This looks like we are watching NDTV. I feel series should not take any political stand very clearly. It can have vantage point what one person think. We are not here to see what a director/ writer thinks.Ending is very awkward, like some good suspense ending , come-on we are not watching hindi movie ""Teri Meharbaniya""This is my personal view."

Loved the way it subtly potryas the recent indian socio political scenario.
Overwhelmed with the vintage sarcasm & dark comedy. I always heard good comedy can come out of very serious situations too, perfect example of that.Thrilled with the vividity of the charecters.
First three or four episodes was building the backdrop and suddenly it bowls you over with its brilliance.

1,45 out of 105 found this helpful,Script written in a hurry!,neetabora,17 May 2020,"Many loop holes. I don't understand why policemen were running to Chitrakoot or Punjab without even interrogating the criminals properly.
Communication is missing in many places, assumptions are made.
Just coz the story writer knew they were connected to Chitrakoot, the police went there, even though they had the criminals in their hand. And they're running themselves, they could've either contacted local Chitrakoot police for info or sent any junior officer. They're listening to criminal's background stories like Panchtantras while not spending enough time to interrogate them in lockup.
It's very slow many times! No good dialogues too. I feel sorry for Gul Panag the most.
Also, it's very painful that series are extremely left leaning nowadays. I expect series to bring out good & bad in all communities as there are good & bad people in every religion. Why do we always have to run a propaganda? It's like listening to a friend after his/her divorce. They'll always tell how good they are but ex wife/ husband is bad etc.
The non veg in train scene - very kiddish. I've travelled with people from muslim, non muslim communities & they never bring non veg in train. It's not about religion but food habits. Fellow passengers might get uncomfortable or meat get spoilt. Even my family is non veg, but we never carry it in train.
This shows the script wasn't given much thought. Very immature & unrealistic approach.Although I liked their acts but giving less rating since it doesn't deserve 8."

Crisp script and shooting locales and cinematography superb. But the background score is hauntingly brilliant and it stays with you after the series is over. Can't wait for the sequel.

2,24 out of 53 found this helpful,End Will Break all our Expectations,moreswapnil-80182,24 May 2020,I will rate this series on basis of a content. The writer has introduced mythological character A Dog and Hiranyakashyup . He wish to relate few characters to them and this is where the trouble arises. The director couldnt do justice to specify this plot.Minority situation has been shown from one point of view which has been done from past. They are suppressed. A more hard hitting end would have made me give 8/10.

10,24 out of 53 found this helpful,Simply Awesome,tejasnaik-00095,19 May 2020,"A web series which outstandingly portrays all the possible layers of today's society, the casteism which is still prevalent in some parts of India, how people will ruin so many lives for their own personal gains, and how fake news and stories can be so dangerous. There is no Hinduphobia in it. It is the bitter truth and we need to swallow it. The world is not all merry merry. We must embrace both the good and the bad."
3,22 out of 48 found this helpful,"Apart from Hype, this show has nothing.",unrivaledraj,22 May 2020,"This show is really bad, I mean like literally terrible. And it isn't because of a religious angle or Hinduphobia, because there's no such thing in the show. Apart from a few scenes that shows a muslim being a mob lynched or has to hear some racial slurs in his workplace which is very true, this show doesn't even attempt to create any kind of religious angle, the bad reviews here based on such things are just ardently stupid and themselves view everything through a religious glass.
This show is bad in terms of story, acting, screenplay, music and direction. You have actors like Neeraj Kabi, Rajesh Sharma and the director and writer had no clue as to how to utilise them on screen. The series span to 9 episodes, which is just a waste of time and could have wrapped this up in 4-5 episodes. So many sub plots are created and have absolutely NO relevance to the main arc, like-
1. Hathiram's son and the scenes of his gun or school, or his class etc have no relation to the story, and doesn't impact Hathiram in anyway. Waste of time.
2. Sanjeev Mehra's wife(Swastika) and her anxiety, I don't know why did they put it on the show, makes no sense to the story, her love for dogs was enough relevance, a good amount of time is wasted on her anxiety which is utter stupidity in terms of relevance to the story.
3. Hathiram's brother in law and his wife scenes, has nothing to do with main plot.
4. The four accused in the attempted murder, apart from Vishal Tyagi's character backstory, none of the other 3 stories matter or has any kind of impact on the main plot and so much time is spent in explaining their character backstory and it doesn't even impact the main plot, like replace these 3 with any other tom, dick and harry and the main plot won't change even a bit. Such is the irrelevance.
This shows biggest problem is the story, there's nothing for the actors to act upon. They tried a bit of Sacred Games here, trying to establish all the characters and portraying their backstories spanning decades, but where they fail is that every Sacred Games characters backstory is directly/indirectly related to the main plot, while in Paatal lok it's all haywire. It would have been much better if they had turned this into a mini stories and put in some better roles for the cast to portray. This series is way below average. And I'd like to say again, there's no religious angle to main plot. People themselves are racist to view it in such angle."

8,13 out of 26 found this helpful,"SwargLok , Dharti Lok and then there is ""PAATAL LOK""",Hussain-AL-Naseer,16 May 2020,"Disclaimer: I'll try to keep this review as short as possible but I'm afraid I couldn't so bear with me, but if you're reading this, I'll make sure its gonna worth it.
So finally, we are in the era where OTT's is the new game, it is not only changing and getting popular by providing its viewers a whole new home-based experience but if we see the other side it is giving confidence to the producers to take risk's, giving free hand to its writers - directors to play creatively and more authentically as much as they can with minimum to practically no censorship along with the actors who deserve the characters as according to their capabilities and finally getting the praises and due credit they deserve and Pataal Lok is its latest and genuine example.
It is one of the finest Thrillers I've seen, giving us the closer look to reality about the bitter and darker face of the society. The series portrays the Communal and cast system along with politics that media plays to form and to manipulate the perception of the society, and that too without being judgmental to these issues for which the credit goes to the writer and directors of the series including Hardik Mehta & Avinash Arun among others for which they truly deserve the round of applause.
Skipping about the series plot as you should watch it by yourself, I'll directly jumps towards the performances. Each and every performance is hitting the right notch, casting has been done brilliantly providing the blend of seasoned acclaimed actors such as Vipin Sharma, Neeraj Kabi alongside Vikram Kapoor & Rajesh Sharma with their brief but valuable appearances, followed by young aspiring actors including Mairembam Ronaldo, Ishwak Singh with the standout performance by Abhishek Banerjee as Vishal ""Hathoda"" Tyagi, his presence will surely give you chills.
As I stated above and one of the reasons, I support the OTT platform is that actors getting the roles they deserve and for this particular series the Man of the Show is Jaideep Ahlawat the main lead of the series doing all the heavy liftings and doing it all effortlessly. Ahlawat as Hathiram Chaudhary an Inspector with a passion to solve the biggest case of his life to prove himself worthy not just as policeman but as Husband and as Father also. He was both comfortable and convincing in each and every scene for which again credit also goes to the writers because they didn't imposed anything, like the use of slang- Gaali's were not forced but genuine like for example a dialogue 'Pori Zindagi apne baap ki aankhon mei dekha aai ke mera beta Chutiya aai, ab apne bete ki aankhon mei nahi dekhna chahata ke uska baap chutiya aai'.
This single dialogue by Hathiram Chaudhary is enough to describe his whole life.
The series also constantly connects the situation with the Hindu mythologies and what has been written in their scriptures as Paatal lok itself is taken from it yet again the writing is so lit that all the references are been delivered lightly as Hathiram after describing all the mythology saying 'Waise tou yeh sab Shahstaron mei likha aai, Mager meine WhatsApp pe parha aai'.
In the end I would also like to appreciate the producers i.e. the Clean Slate Films and Anushka Sharma for not ending the series open ended or incomplete for future seasons as I've seen now days its been a norm that if the series got hit makers do keep room for further stretching it into seasons, which is not the case with this series and it shouldn't be with any of the other series where it is not required."

It's honesty which does not shy away from obscenely to make you uncomfortable.

Such an unused raw talent. the scene where he walks out after suspension and when he his immediate guilt on the use the word ""Katwa"" are testament to the vast range of emotions he is capable of being true to while acting.

The best thing about this series is the fact that a team of really strong writers worked in this. The main showrunner Sudip Sharma is the man behind movies like Udta Punjab, NH 10 and Sonchiriya. Hence, we get a show with a lot of layers. It's a show which has a lot of depth, which has lot to say to it's viewers regarding the current socio political setup of the country. It may be offending to some, as I can already see that people are strategically down voting the series, calling it biased, anti nationalist etc. Well, the show is exactly about these things. These people are a living proof that whatever has been shown in the show happens in today's India. This is not a dystopian vision of India, neither does it depict our country in that state of utopia, which the people down voting it here make it out to be.It shows bitter reality.
The performances, especially that of Jaideep Ahlawat and Abhishek Banerjee are fantastic.
Overall, I would say this is another show with good content from Amazon prime. They are really doing a good job. Keep it up!"

8,12 out of 25 found this helpful,Riveting with Superb Performance,topmoviesblogs,15 May 2020,"Amzazon Prime is lately coming up with very interesting series like Panchaayat, Upload and now with Paatal Lok. Avinash Arun and Prosit Roy has given their best from this series. It is one of the best crime thriller.Story/ScreenplayA high profile journalist from leading TV channel is planned to be murdered by 4 criminals but CBI catches them before they could attempt that plan. Case is handed over to local police where Hathi Ram Chaudhary played by ""Jaideep Ahlawat"" is an inspector who has been given the responsibility to solve this case of conspiracy of murder. As this is what you see in first episode, but the remaining 8 episodes are powerful , riveting and binge watch worthy. This is one of the most balance and no - nonsense series I have recently come across. I can definitely include Sacred Games, Asur and Mirzapur to be a bit too much just to titillate audience. As the story is about one crime which unfolds many different stories about different characters the screenplay is smart and makes sure that you are invested in it throughout. It has almost everything, you can call every cliched' aspect but still it manages to be fresh and raw. You call it Muslim angle, representation, LGBTQ, Caste system, power of politics, father-son tussle, even animal love surprisingly you are with every story even if you see a rap music starts to play in a village of Punjab.DirectionPlease check the link about the Directors, but I must mention that both the directors Avinash Arun & Prosit Roy have given their soul to this. You see uncanny peacefulness and their are moment where you see their is something big is going to happen and the clock is ticking for that. Realism and compelling is the key for their success in this one.OthersI must highlight Dialogues of the series, what a gem it has given. Dialogues are fresh, funny, unheard of and real. Camerawork is also top notch and it directly take you to the place from first scene. Background music and Rap song is really good and goes with the story line.ActorsI have always loved these actors, I can be really biased. But I am genuinely telling every one is really good. I must say Jaideep Ahlawat is at his best. Jaideep Ahlawat take a bow!!! Sadly I don't see him as many movies or series but he has done excellent job. Ishwaq Singh playing new Inspector Imran Ansari is also pretty good. , Abhishekh Banerjee playing Tyagi is effective and menacing. He delivers what he should have done. Gul Panag, Vipin Sharma, Rajesh Sharma, Mairembam Ronaldo Singh do their job with utmost sincerity. You can not say any other actor could have replaced anyone. The casting has been excellent.OverallI am super glad to say that my earlier blog about Top 5 reason to watch Paatal Lok was already been seen by many and appreciate that my instinct about the series was right. Nevertheless I can not claim to have any reason to understand the powerful story behind this crime thriller. The way they have placed DOG in this story is amazing and master stroke.This is superb series and better than few stupid series like ""Four More Shots Please"" which stupidly talks about feminism. So please watch this and give these directors and actors what they deserve. Thank you Anushka Sharma's Clean Slate production house to start their first web series with such a wonderful script. Kudos to you again!!!Must Watch of #AmazonPrimeIndia,Image used for awareness purpose"

10,4 out of 6 found this helpful,Content is the king - speechless!!! Watch it!,neeraj-singh,19 May 2020,"Please do not read reviews - first watch it and then come and read and write reviews as I did. It is so pleasing to watch Indian Web Series getting matured so quickly in its content, writing and presentation. Actors and talent have always been in abundance.Paatal Lok is the story of a father whose one dialogue summarizes the entire series - ""Pori Zindagi apne baap ki aankhon mei dekha ki mera beta Chutiya aai, ab apne bete ki aankhon mei nahi dekhna chahata ke uska baap chutiya aai"". We all in one or other way is trying to prove one or another thing. And the decisions taken in this course of action becomes the defining story of our life. From the beginning, you soon get completely engrossed to this central theme that you don't pay more attention to any references to religion, caste and politics through out. All these are there to carry the story forward but never takes the pace away from its core values.Another thing that works in its favor - the protagonist is not a super hero - doesn't deliver heavy dialogues or appears to come out of any situation unscathed. Credit goes to the entire crew for entertaining us right from the first episode till the end. Providing us with a drama that ends but the character stays with us for a long time. Relationship between a father and his son, a teacher and his disciple doesn't let the story stray away. You develop sympathy with characters because there is no hero or villain. Everyone is part of a well - oiled machinery.Go and watch this gem. You will not regret even a single episode because they have not wasted any single character (even a dog). There is hardly a dull moment."

Without accepting that these things are the part of current society. The people who support these things fully are the one's giving the low ratings and negative comments. They don't want the reality to be shown but are happy with the fake cover ups.Go and watch this.... for a new era of reality has gone a level up with this.

Jaideep ahuja(Hathiram chaudhry) and all the other cast did a honest job and acted quiet well. I might say Paatal lok showed the real struggle of police in India and of middle class in India. If you are looking for a webseries that would be like ALT balaji web series or like Shah rukh khan's bard of the blood then its not for you. Its a well writing and directed web series that i ejoyed watching and watched whole episode one after another. Eagerly waiting for season 2.

While Netflix has bren delivering duds one after another, Amazon has been consistently bringing out great content which can and will bring glory to Indian filmmaking globally.
Coming back to the series, it is gripping, hard hitting and enjoyable. Showing the eternal complexities of the ""system"" in which everyone is but a cog in the wheel. While the system cant be changed, few good men do try and do things differently but fail.
A dark and foreboding tale of our times and for all times to come."
9,4 out of 6 found this helpful,Paatal Lok: Jamuna paar ya hindustan?!,mrdlsinha,16 May 2020,"Reviewing Paatal Lok.""Ye jo duniya hain na, ye ek nahi teen duniya hain, sabse upar swarg lok jisme devta rehte hain, beech mein dharti lok, jisme admi rehte hain, aur sabse niche paatal lok, jisme keede rehte hain- waise sastro mein likha hain, maine whatsapp mein padha tha"". And the show starts.
Paatal lok is nothing but the Outer Jamuna Paar Police Station as described by inspector Hathi Ram Chaudhury, our protagonist here. He's being Paatal Lok for fifteen years but there's no scope in his career.
But as the show progress we see the real Paatal lok which is the real India itself.
Paatal Lok is harshly political and shows the value of power and system in India within.
The show starts with Delhi police capturing four suspects at the express highway for planning to kill a famous journalist Sanjeev Mehra played extraordinarily by Neeraj Kabi.
The four suspects and their history are the harsh truth of 'hindustan' and emotionally captured by the makers. You will be stunned and feel for them for what they are.
Paatal Lok shows the power, conspiracy, betrayal and the system itself. It catches you and despite of having layer stories you will not be diverted a bit.
A story of investigation, bureaucracy, truth of media, rural politics, a father son relationship and religion.
Jaideep Ahlawat as Hathi Ram Chaudhury is mind blowing. He always sees himself as a Chutiya but the audience may not agree with him. His father-son-father relationship portrays the lower middle class confusions and frustrations in the society. At one point he continuously slams, curses and throws all his frustrations in front of his son, and that scene is hilarious.
Neeraj Kabi as Sanjeev Mehra has created a tone of sharpness and delivers what-is-known-but-unknown in the media.
Swastika Mukherji does not deliver what she is capable of.
Ishwak Singh as sub inspector Imran Ansari has done a tremendous work.
A lot of others have done justice with their role and Avishek Banerjee as Vishal Hatoda Tyagi is bluntly superb.
But the creators have done justice with the character analysis of the four suspects and their stories.
Directors Avinash Arun and Prosit Roy, and creator Sudip Sharma did not focus on a happy note; and thus Paatal Lok doesn't have an end.
At the end only the viewers can watch the whole scenario and maybe they can enter into the system itself: Paatal Lok."

I had to watch it because of Tyagi (my school time friend) and the show didn't disappoint me. The makers had given due respect to each of its character and built a good crime show.
To all the critics pointing out that the show is a propaganda to malign the Hindutva movement, i would say you failed to see the large picture here when its really heartbreaking to see the injustice done to low-caste in rural areas, incidence of child molestation etc. which lead them to enter the crime world and become just pawns for those who are in power."

Here, they come into their own and are Emmy worthy in their respective performance.The backstories are ringed with casteism, communalism, sexism, child abuse, fratricide, to name just a few.

Kudos to the casting director to have chosen such a fine ensemble of actors (good see you Gul Panag). Jaideep Ahlawat is in especially fine form here. The show tries to provide back stories to both the good guys as well as the bad guys.

The lead character Jaideep won the heart and left us for wanting more,cant wait for season 2."
8,29 out of 72 found this helpful,"Admiring direction, beautiful screenplay, solid performances by the entire star cast will keep you on the edge of the seat",ketgup83,16 May 2020,"As we begin the premier show of Anushka Sharma and Amzaon Studio new web series, Pataal Lok, we are introduced to three different worlds which literally means Swarg Lok where high-class people live, Dharti Lok where middle class folks stays and the Pataal Lok where criminals, murderers and evil thrive. It is the third world which gives insight into the mind of a criminal and what makes the convict go through the rough path which is the crux of the web series Pataal Lok.
This year we witnessed an enriching yet gruesome and spine chilling experience with Asur web series which was praised for its powerful screenplay. Now Amazon Studio and Anushka Sharma brings more heat this summer with Pataal Lok which will take you for a ride to heaven through hell.Based on Tarun Tejpal's novel The Story of My Assassins, Paatal Lok tells the story of a struggling police inspector (Jaideep Ahlawat) who follows an investigation into the attempted murder of an eminent journalist (Neeraj Kabi) by a group of four violent gangsters headed by Vishal ""Hathoda"" Tyagi (Abhishek Banerjee). The series introduces four accused suspected of the murder but as evidence starts disappearing and the police face increasingly more bureaucracy and obstacles the closer they get to the truth, the investigation becomes more complicated.Directed by Avinash Arun (Killa) and Prosit Roy (Pari), Pataal Lok will take some time to build upon you but when it does there is no coming back. The best part of watching Pataal Lok web series is that you will be shown three different worlds which is very much existing in today's scenario - Swarg Lok which shows the fake life of a popular TV journalist who is swindling between a loving wife and still handling extra-marital affair with his office assistant. Dharti Lok which focuses on the middle class and probably the most relatable one where an honest police officer is trying to make a career and yet struggling with his rebellious son and a nagging wife.We are finally introduced to the third world, Pataal Lok, which shows the coming-of-age story of the four antagonist who plan to assassinate a high-profile media person. The web-series flips between past and present scenes to show the making of criminals through diverse stories woven together with same outcome. While first few episodes will be easy-going to watch, it is the twist and turns in the later part where the series gathers the steam. The best scene is where Haathi Ram thrashes his son's friend for hiding the gun.The scene will bring down the house with fantastic act by Jaideep Ahlawat.Pataal Lok has few similarities with Abhay Deol starrer Manorama-Six Feet Under , of course it was expected as Navdeep Singh is the script consultant here. Like a suspended PWD engineer but a detective-wanna-be Abhay Deol takes on solving the mystery behind the disappearance of a 6 year old girl from NGO in Manorama, our protagonist, Haathi Ram Chaudhary, in Pataal Lok, even though suspended, becomes curious to solve the mystery behind the attempted assassination of an eminent journalist. There is a lot of twist and turns which needs to watched carefully and the director succeeds you keeping engaged right till the end.On the flip side, I feel the length of the web-series could have trimmed by few minutes while a better background score could have made Pataal Lok more engrossing. The highlight of the web-series is the admiring direction, beautiful screenplay, solid performances by the entire star cast will help to enjoy the web-series. Hats off to Jaideep Ahlawat who gives the best performance of his career. The actors goes deep into his character as he was playing a real-life cop with aplomb. Abhishek Banerjee will surprise you with deadly and daring looks as ""Hathora"" Tyagi. I wish I could see more of his scenes in the 9 episodes web series. Neeraj Kabi is stunning as the high-profile journalist. Ishwak Singh and Niharika Lyra Dutta were superb. Swastika Mukherjee and Gul Panag leaves a solid impression even though they have small roles to play.Pataal Lok is a fantastic who-done-it crime thriller that will certainly keep you on the edge of your seat. Highly recommended 4/5"

This is the answer to those who ask why doesn't India have Scorsese or Tarantino.Okay yes this is not any Tarantino level stuff but we are getting there. No one can deny this isn't a step in that direction. Prime is working fast and hard to give us content that till now only Netflix used to possess. In the OTT wars we are the winners. All 9 episodes are worth your time. Jaideep Alhawat is terrific and on top of every scene. Gul Panag and Neeraj Kabi work hand in hand with Jaideep. Special mention to child actors. India really has started to cast proper junior actors recently.There are many messages to take, many discussions to have. This show doesn't pull any punches to show stark reality. Backstories of every character is brutally explored and some will punch you in the gut.I hope there is a season 2 and we see more of these fine actors.P. S.

It's one of the darkest and disturbing TV show and sometimes it becomes difficult to watch but then you look beyond and see how difficult it must have been to film it. I could never imagine a Indian TV series could be so brilliant, so amazing that whatever I have seen in the past looks weak and to an extent... Lame!
This is the best Indian TV series by a long shot and one of the best in the world... If not the best!
The research work done on this is just ridiculous, things which have been shown in this can't be imagined if someone hasn't gone through them. The direction, the acting, the cinematography... Everything is top notch and the very best! The bar they have now set for Indian television would be difficult to beat.

10,11 out of 23 found this helpful,Made in India...and made FOR India..must watch!,ankitthedon-sharma,17 May 2020,"My rating says it all ..hence I will come down directly to basics.
Acting: Just fabulous. Jaideep has always been the top notch actor and I don't know how directors used to overlook him. Shout out for Abhishek Banerjee...please directors ..cast him more..and give him all dark characters that you used to have Nawaz Bhai in. He is more authentic killer. Neeraj is like always..flawless yet in a flawed character. Others too played their role very well. Seeing Gul Panag after so long was refreshing..and she did a decent job ..even as a housewife.
Direction : Mind-blowing. This director should be directly admitted to the league of Tigmanshu, Anurag and Mehta. I have no words to describe how well he has directed this.
Story : Heart wrenching... True story of UP MP Punjab and outskirts of Delhi. Bhakts will dislike it because their faces have been exposed at many times. Had a feel that this was about politics but it's not...politics is there just like 'Kadi-patta' in your curry. Those who are sledging it are Tiger Shroff fans and wanted tiger typos in this movie...but this show being 'real'... tiger didn't make a cut.
Thrill/suspense : I have been awake all night and finished just 6 episodes...had to take breaks in between to gulp the suspense. It keeps you on the edge of your seat all the time.Comparison to others : Cannot compare to sacred games..but yeah Jaideep acted far better than our Nawab Saab . Story too is not as convoluted as Sacred Games. However it is far far better and 'real' as compared to Apaharan sort of gimmicks.Must watch for : PataalLok ..if you are interested in ground zero of Indian crime scene. Jaideep Ahlawat, Abhishek Banarjee, Neeraj ..bind you to the screen within first 15 minutes. To understand the problems of Indian villages. The society has been unmasked.Must watch. You won't regret it. And yes Muslims are looked down upon and so are Dalits and women. So dont cringe at reality..change it. I am an upper caste Hindu saying this to all haters( illiterate ppl) out there.
Tc."

Abhishek Banerjee work was also amazing though in whole series he got less dialogue but the expressions and body language was top notch.His son's character was also a good one.Then Neeraj Kabi was good, thought the climax was a bit let down as expected more. Series will throughout hold you till the end and never creates a loose end which shows how the good direction is. So must watch and it's amazing.Must remember - That good deeds are always common in every lok."

Kudos to Jaideep ahlawat for brilliant acting. Also special mention for the muslim inspector who won the hearts with his brilliant acting.Plot is bit tricky but sums up well in the end, provides a satisfactory ending.Shooting and setting is good.Though i expected more from abhishek bannerjee, but his role was small though satisfactory. Also i liked his partner in crime, tope singh.Overall, good option to spend your weekend with, and definitely a better ending then The family man."

Story feels bit slow.,abhipise,16 May 2020,"Story depicts lots of angles of indian society, and leaves audience with a simple message that showing humanity doesn't cost you, and will indeed be a benefit. All the actors have worked really hard in portraying the characters. Especially the lead Jaideep Ahlawat playing cop hathi ram choudhary. Story feels a bit slow and could've been faster.

I must say imho that the credit should go to direction and that makes the a complex story easy to follow , still intriguing and one to follow till you close.I binged watched - 9 hrs !"

8,14 out of 31 found this helpful,Highly Recommended: Prime getting it right with the Indian content,alphadude007,16 May 2020,"There was Netflix's sacred games, which can be summed up in one word - EPIC. But, it seems like Netflix has lost the plot, at least with Indian content since. This is where Amazon prime came in with Family Man, Mirzapur, Breathe, and now Paatal Lok. No hyped up commercial actors, just a great story and actors who put their heart and soul into the series. The series was very well set-up, paced, acted, and wrapped up. No irrationalities or jarring logical issues or character inconsistencies during the first viewing. Essential watching. Very very good!"
10,14 out of 31 found this helpful,A show to watch definitely,imtiazu,16 May 2020,"This is writing at its best. From the first scene itself you can see the palpable sense of tension.
The powerful acting and the production design. The realistic set design and costume design adds Midas touch to the show.
Music is there just to insinuate the emotions sowed by the writers deep down into the characters.
This show is character play at its best.
Never ever expected such a well written show to come from India.Nothing feels more great than an well written character...It is almost orgasmic to see a flawed, realistic and raw representation of a carefully crafted character...Hathiram Choudhary is probably The One...P.S. - And hard hitting for a reason. It hits you hard."

9,14 out of 31 found this helpful,A top class Afrighting Political Crime Thriller.,pritambag,16 May 2020,"Absolutely speechless after seeing such a horrifying political Crime Thriller. The series which starts with the segregation of Heaven, Earth and Hell in the world itself between different classes of people. But with time everything mixes up. The series highlights how each and every official has the tendency to take their piece of pie in between conflicts. The series sheds light on the naked society and how the society sets up the crime, the criminal only commits it, is the main premise of the story. The performances were brilliant including Jaideep Ahlawaat, Neeraj Kabi, Swastika Mukherjee, M.R.Singh and many more but the showsteller was Abhishek Banerjee as Hathoda Tyagi. The storyline, execution was of top notch. If you wanna watch a top class political crime thriller then this is the one. Go for it."

The storyline is impeccable and the characters have multiple layers to them. Every actor has done a tremendous job in portaying their characters and not for even a single second you will feel that the story is lagging or having loose ends. There are so many raw scenes and a bit of nudity in some of the episodes which only makes the series so realistic and gullible at the same time. The series has touched all the topics existing in today's social and political era from gang rapes, contract murder, fake news created by media, political influences on the law and order of a state, oppression of muslim minority, etc. I mean you name it and the series has it and the best thing is that even after touching so many topics and issues the series for once doesn't feel like over load of information or out of the context story telling. If you guys have not watched it yet, I would definitely recommend you to watch this series as this is a pure work of good story telling, cinematography and ambitious direction."

Keeping this aside (if you don't prefer to indulge in discussing the reality of the world), the series still clicks, the screenplay is gripping and the story builds till the last moment.

Neeraj Kabi is also in good in touch. There is great show in terms of supporting performances by Ishwak Singh, Niharika Lyra Dutt, Rajesh Sharma, Swastika Mukherjee, Jagjeet Sandhu, Akash Khurana, Anup Jalota and Savitri(Dog).Script: After Asur, trailer of Paatal Lok gave hint for another mythological based crime drama series. However it is totally disappointed with the genre except web-series title Paatal Lok. It started with some crime and then drill down to history of crime and ended with pre-mature conclusion. In final episode, audience need more crispy and nail-biting thriller.

Neeraj kabi is too good. Love you parulikar. But the man of the match is a cop, Jaideep.

This added a strong closeness with reality.Unlike some movies or series there is no happy ending, or revenge or promotions or medals. It is what it is. Not to make a viewer happy, but keep him excited, eager and make the story as close to a practical life.Now about the cast - as the lead Jaideep Alahwat has delivered a act of his lifetime. every scene is perfect, powerful and as real as it gets. The entire cast is nicely cast. Kudos to the team for a brilliant acting performance.Finally, when it comes down to it, Pataal Lok cuts through its own clutter and shows things as it is.. each character a creature of his circumstance, and gets us to ask: is anyone purely evil? Let's ask the Dog.."

I dont know why the right wing is getting triggered by this show as nothing about this show is anti hindu.
Although these bad reviews are reflecting the true face of this venomous people who can only see a thing pro hindu or anti hindu.
Coming to acting shows main protagonist jaydeep ahlawat has finally got a role worthy of his calibre for which i thank the casting team And the producers.
Neeraj kabi is the actor whose projects i look after too..he is a tremendous actor and does all kind of roles at equal perfection.
Actor who played inspector imran was so natural
Othe actors were great too at their roles standouts were cheeni, tope singh, dolly.. even kabeer m with his small role..
Story was beautifully written.
So don't mind the haters as their hate does not come off because its a bad show albeit beacuse of there own political affliction .go ahead and treat yourself this week with this great show.
Also a big thanks to anushka sharma who produced this show.you showed again that you are the future of this entertainment industry..looking forward to your new project."

I took 24 hours to finish the show. I suggest you take no longer. Some power house performances from men who have since earned the right for their names to be remembered by heart. So many characters, well woven; this is excellent, deep and beyond cynical reproach. My rating of 10 is wholly deserved."

10,6 out of 11 found this helpful,A dark and gory look at India's underbelly,saudrehman-38260,16 May 2020,"A very 'Fincheresque' look at the wicked underbelly of Delhi and the adjoining cow belt. Not that this has not been done before, but this seems so refreshingly well written and executed on screen that its almost unputdownable once you start watching it.
It is based on the book by Tarun Tejpal 's 2009 novel, The Story of My Assassins.
Excellent layered story and well etched characters with varying shades of grey.
Paatal Lok, is told from the viewpoint of a washed-out cop played by Jaideep Ahlawat who gets a case which he thinks is his chance at glory and promotion. When we first meet him he is, like Morgan Freeman's Detective Somerset in Se7en, giving a rookie a rambling lecture on the irredeemable nature of human beings. Jaideep Ahlawat has really given the performance of a lifetime.
I do not want to give the story but just wanted to highlight that within the story there is so much subtle commentary on the sad situation in today's majoritarian India. The bigotry, greed, hypocrisy, class and religious divide in India is excellently blended into the script. The corporatisation of the media industry is an idea that is also explored through a subplot. In fact, there are so many themes, plots and subplots in this, you are extremely overwhelmed watching it.
The characters have been very well enacted especially say, the rookie Muslim cop Ansari who must put with the casual bigotry in the workplace while still passionately doing his job with unflinching honesty. All the 4 criminals who have been brutalized in the past by their circumstances especially the hammer wielding Hathoda Tyagi are also very well enacted. In a majoritarian society, they are from the wrong caste, religion and sexuality. However they are all vital for the kind of dirty work that nobody else wants to do and disposable too.
The only gripe could be the gruesome violence, sex and expletives used. But I guess the writers wanted the viewer to feel the horror and make them flinch.
Paatal Lok is an intense exploration of Indian society both its immorality but also its redeeming qualities.
This is a must watch for anyone."

While some of its content is worth lauding such as mistreatment of Dalits in the Hindu society, however justifying it with crime & murder shouldn't be accepted. Also, worth noting is caste system is an age-old disease and has nothing to do with a Nationalist Govt. coming to power. Infact parties such as SP and BSP who claim to be Dalit and minority Messiahs have done pitiful.
The web-series is full of propaganda and they do it by throwing names like ""Gauri Lankesh"" and words/phrases like ""leftists"", ""nationalists"", ""batala house"" etc. It portrays that the whole Govt. machinery is all of sudden anti-Muslims, even CBI, Delhi Police and higher Govt authorities. The series attempts to justify what the Pakistani PM Imran Khan, Congress & its allies spread about India. Not worth watching.

-It's a one sided narrative, but that could be the point. Other side of the story could be told another day.
-Morality of the lead character was lost in the ending chapters... he did not want his child to look down on him and desperately tried solving the case. But in the end, it all got lost
-Too many unused Chekhov's Gun were placed in the story
-Gul Panag's acting was a letdown.
-Story was weaved similar to Sacred Games...using similar mytho touch..Also few minute flaws and error which could be Neglected..Positivies :
with its flaws, its a gripping tell...one wants to watch the underdog policeman trying hard to unearth the real coup.Acting from Niraj Kabi & Ahlawat was phenomenal... superbin between real issues were highlighted, casteism, issues with third gender, minority issues, classism, etc. Believe it or not, it does exist in our society.It'a must watch series.

10,5 out of 9 found this helpful,One of the Finest and well-rounded TV series in crime drama genre by India,biswajoy-50613,19 May 2020,"Strictly from a viewers point of view.. I enjoyed it thoroughly..one of the finest TV series in this genre produced by India. Ofcourse it does not reach the benchmark set by sacred games, mirzapur or the family man, but is REALLY close and original. The acting and casting is impeccable. The story is solid, tight, and well rounded. Loved the controversy, violence, and drama! Loved the attention to details. Loved the unadulterated rawness. Loved how swear words were cheekily yet appropriately used. It shows issues of prejudice in several fronts (religion, caste, gender/sexuality, species)..of the not so strawberry dunia of Delhi and Bengal in parts. The only issue I had was I expected more thrills, the ending was okay-ish, everything was answered i.e. no loose ends as such (which is a good thing for a lot of people but not me, I like a mysterious ending with multiple possibilities upon the discretion of the viewer like in Sacred Games or Andhadhun)."

I had no doubt about the screenplay when I saw the writers' names , the direction is also great and I hope I don't need to talk about acting of the tremendously talented actors(even chaddis are also accepting it).So go and watch and help to give reviews also by stopping the spam of the chaddis.I just want to add one thing that chaddis go get a life and dont spam. It will be better if you invest your time in something which can give you a good life. As you will not get a good life by glorifying religion, you need to work hard."

While there are many streaming service and original there are very very very few series which truly deserves a praise like this one.
Netflix once set a bar with Sacred Games and from then we saw a competition between Prime and Netflix. But this time, Amazon really outdone our expectations.
The really credits goes to casting director who assembled a cast consists of talent not good looks and what the Indian Entertainment Industry and audience wants the talent not good looks and glamour.
That's why in this time, Paatal lok is a hit while Malang like movies considered Trash.
Direction is amazing and the dialogues and the combination of ancient story with the plot is beautifully describe.
They have to understand the Indian Culture is truly amazing and one can create a well-written content from it.

But this series has satisfied climax with some thrills. The storyline is good and especially the intro of Chanda was interested. However there is less thrill than some other Hindi series but the pace of the screenplay hides all other things. There should be some more things about Dunalia and Vajpai. It may add some thrills to. Gul Panag is at her best but Jaideep did very best of him and good to see him in this avtar. He is in line with Pankaj Tripathi soon.

Fantastically narrated story with reality.,kkmallick-58668,17 May 2020,"Nothing can be said more except the fact that this is one of the best non-English series I have seen on recent times. There can be hits like Mirzapur / Sacred Games etc but this one makes you think, it makes you just use your own brain, smartness, intelligence to unravel the mystery.It makes you feel the pain some people from our own country have to go through since their childhood days.It makes you hate our society too who makes innocent people convert to criminals due to the society's misjudgement, mockery, bullying, personal hunger etc. etc.Enough can't be said of the perfect writing, casting, direction and acting in this series.This is what should come out of the talent from the industry we have.
As most of the movies coming out from the hindi industry are just for commercial success but not to do some good to the society or to give a wake up call to the blindfolded public (the percentage of which is growing nowadays). They do nothing more than to earn money for the producers.More series like Paatal Lok and movies like Dhadak, Article 15 should come out as I support such creations which highlight the wrongdoings in our society and make them clearly visible to the public to show them what's right and what's wrong, to show them who's right and who's wrong.Must watch definitely. I hope these talented teams of directors, script writers, actors bring more of these.Covers almost everything, every evil thing like Fake news (you can guess the names of big top shot media journalists who shout and spread fake breaking news to capture TRPs just to earn money.. once you complete the series you can easily guess), then land disputes, child abuse, women used as objects of revenge, honest/dishonest journalists, honest/dishonest cops, extramarital affairs, most importantly bad Politicians creating everything bad in the system from head to tail.So I just want to appreciate Amazon Prime to bring in such quality series in their bucket for the viewers. Keep up the great work and hope to see such more in future.

While it never rises to the levels of Sacred Games (Season 1 atleast), superb performances from Jaideep Ahlawat (Officer Hathiram) and Neeraj Kabi (Sanjeev Mehra) elevate the series to a single weekend binge watch that will leave you yearning for more.Directors Avinash Arun and Prosit Roy have managed to capture the essence of current Indian politics, castelism, islamophobia, the spread of fake news and sesnationalistic journalism all in one finely written plot. Even the smallest characters are superbly cast with a special shout out to Mairembam Singh (Cheeni) and Abhishek Banerjee (Hathoda Tyagi).Well worth the weekend binge. Hoping for a season 2"

Every character has its own mini story. It's not an easy task to keep entertaining with a firm grip on reality. Every bit of it was real, no plastic. Smart direction with controlled and precise articulation of every emotion WITHOUT explaining what exactly happened, in the next scene. As a view either I was smart enough to understand the script and director's efforts or the pace it went made me to. And finally the way it ends with that bhajan, no words to explain, kind of worth spending time watching it an awesome feeling of making a good decision. This was the first time I ever listened to this bhajan. and have been listening to it for last 24 hours :)Kudos to the whole team, congratulations!!

Eating meat cooked by the Hindu cook (maharaj) in front of Ma Durga and cow was sick.
2- Mob lynching over beef by karsewaks was another twisted version of a sick mind. The Makers have used it to show that Hindus who have had a long court battle for the holy birth place of God Ram are murderers and they lynch every beef eater. Sacred games had shown similar thing.
3- The crass use of Brahmin politician using Gangajal after visiting a dalit family. I mean it looks idiotic.
4- CBI is so so stupid to put the blame on ISI. I mean they really thought they could pull it off. They think viewer are idiot.
5- These filmmakers think they can feed any BS about small towns and people will believe it.Not everything was bad. Best part were-1- Jaideep Ahlawat (Hathi Ram Chaudhary) has killed it again. I hated you in bard of blood. I was worried about you through out praying for your safety. Your pain and desperation was reaching me.
2- Abhishek Banerjee (Hathoda Tyagi) your eyes were sending chills. Superb acting.Enough is enough. Everytime I watch these propoganda content I really feel what a waste of opportunity. So much talent wasted."

Does they lack of creative writers and creators. A complete waste of time , you guys are just spreading hatr and hurting the religious sentiment of Hindu. A worst web series released on Amazon Prime, which has some successful series like Family Man, Mirzapur, Hostel Daze and all. If you still believe just following the anti hindu storyline will increase your publicity then you guys are wrong. You guys will soon loose the biggest interest audience of the world.

Now the main motive was to kill tyagi. The police knew where he was, the goons knew where he is, he's already a wanted man for 45 murders, could have been a easy shoot out, then why the hell do create a ekta Kapoor drama around it. Just to kill a contract killer.
Bollywood just can't do with out masala , then actual logic."

1,7 out of 16 found this helpful,NDTV in a series,richie-22-86930,19 May 2020,"Hateful, Hinduphobic and filled with propaganda.What's all been shown on leftist news networkz filled with Hatred and trying to malign people of a particular religious belief.The show tries to glorify terror groups and maligns the armed forces who in real are protectors, shows every killer as someone driven with a religious motive who prays in a particular manner.Trying to show people of a sect as hate filled killers.Imagine the religious roles reversed and the antagonist being of the largest Indian minority, this show and its makers wouldn't have probably been alive by now."
6,7 out of 16 found this helpful,"Watchable, but Leftist Propaganda is unmissable !",captarvindtiwari,18 May 2020,"Most importantly, the series has an underlying current of leftist agenda to misguide young impressionable minds by clever and subtle references of anti-majoritarianism and anti-upper caste sequences willfully inserted at regular intervals. Such references have been put EVEN WITHOUT HAVING ANY CONNECTION WITH THE STORYLINE AT ALL - which makes them absurd and the intentions of the makers nefarious.If viewed without applying any brains and watched SIMPLY AS A PIECE OF ART then following observations emerge -Firstly the name Paatal Lok (which is spelt wrongly given its correct pronunciation) is totally out of context/meaning and has been used just for the sake of using some Hindu mythological term.Secondly, the performances part - Jaydeep Ahlawat & Neeraj Kabi manage to impress, the former much more. Gul Panag fails to get into the shoes of her character. Rest of the characters & performances do not have much scope. Found nothing great in the Character of Tyagi - so many pervert criminals/murderers have been scripted and played that its nothing very different or remarkable.Thirdly the script part - First 6 episodes are good, however rest 3 totally loose their plot by the time the series winds up. Gawky, melodramatic villains and sidekicks are introduced which lack conviction,realism or credibility. The story-line also fumbles significantly, however good editing becomes savior to some extent.Verdict : WATCHABLE (Except for the last 3 episodes which become torturous at times)"
1,7 out of 16 found this helpful,"Great leftist propaganda,showing hindus doing all bad stuff",sushant-31614,18 May 2020,"A nice left leaning story which degrades Hindu community. A good Muslim cop humiliated by fellow Hindus, Hindu militant mob, innocent Muslim framed as terrorists by Hindu Baeurocracy. A nice looking Muslim guy lynched by Hindu mob, a liberal reporter, a dalit guy forced to becoming criminal by upper caste goons, a transgender becoming criminal because of homophobic Hindu society, Perfect story for liberal upper middle class population."

Even if you don't like the very genre, do watch it for Jaideep Ahalawat and his exceptional groundbreaking performance. If there was an Indian Emmy, he would be the one to beat Saif Ali Khan or N. Siddique's performance from Sacred Games!The web series takes you the roots of Indian rural gangster connections, rituals, traditions and mythologies that have been beautifully inscribed in each episode. Most like other shows, each episode is a character study but this one goes way into detail and there it stands out a very different show! The direction is spectacular in few scenes (like the one scene where we learn about Cheeni's past and her love for another low-life sweeper friend).Proud of it and the fact it came from our nation."

9,3 out of 5 found this helpful,A authentic taste of the modern world crime story.,Nish3012,17 May 2020,"We are introduced to the Paatal lok with a heavy voice of inspector Haathiram Choudhary played by Jaideep Ahlawat telling his partner, Imran, a text from mythological text of how the world is divided into 3 world- Swaarg lok (heaven), Dharti lok (earth) and Paatal Lok (netherworld) and how the people from this 3 world are categorized and how one act can trigger a big scandal. He goes on say that he has read this on Whatsapp, implying his doubts in the mythological stories. He is shown as ordinary police officer of the outer Jamuna Paar police station, nobody trusts him to perform an investigative task and he explain as ""Boss think we are good only for setting up blockades"". Jaideep Ahlawat is the anchor point of this story and he has got a chance to prove that he can crack a case and he is not a loser. He is hot headed, sharp, and observant but at the same time could be diverted easily. Gul Paang is shown as Haathiram's wife and she delivers a believable performance as a housewife who understands him but is not given much chance to grow into this role.
On the other hand, Neeraj Kabi with his calm and posed posture portraits a news anchor who finds himself at odds with the owner of the news channel and his wife who has anxiety attacks. We feel sorry to see his state but his stature in anyway gives out that he is a poor guy stuck with his destiny. Instead as the series progress we see his character arc changing as how he can manipulate stories. His wife, Swastika Mukherjee (Played Kabi's partner in movie Detective Byomkesh Bakshi) is not given much space to grow, we see her break and how she reconciles the facts about Sanjeev.
The story starts with an arrest of 4 goons who are on their way to kill a Veteran news anchor, Sanjeev Mehra (Neeraj Kabi) by the DCP of Delhi police and this is handed over to Haathiram as it falls under their jurisdiction. Paatal Lok shows how the system though made of everyone has its internal conflicts. Haathiram is chasing different angles and people as the case progress and trying to make connections with different people but cannot create a link, all he has is the 4 goons arrested and their statement but which leads nowhere even after trying to dig into their past.
Abhishek Banerjee as Hathoda Tyagi from TVF's ""humorously yours"" and ""Stree"" fame, does complete justice to his dark character with minimum dialogues but his expression speaks. His story is shown in stages and how it connects to this plot, a local politics and a leader in hiding who is worshipped by not him but people of the region is revealed by Haathiram as the story progress. Interestingly he is also the casting director of this series and has brilliantly casted all the supporting cast. Vipin Sharma, Manish Chaudhary, Asif Basra and Rajesh Sharma all are casted perfectly in their role and create a great ensemble cast.
Watch this series for the direction, cinematography, and power pack performance by the actors. Director Prosit Roy and cinematographer turned Director Avinash Arun portrays the series with a authentic taste of the metro as well as the village with the untold crimes that happens and how they create a circumstances for people to turn dark. Paatal Lok could be described ass a best story telling series of this year. The story being very simple, but it gets convoluted due to the various people in the system trying to take advantage of the situations. How a story could be molded to gain power, status or just revenge forms the crux of Paatal lok. As it is stated with one line as "" System from outside looks a mess, a garbage but if you look closely, from inside you will see it's a well-oiled machinery where each part knows what is his work and if it causes problem, it is replaced."""

The performances are noteworthy, the characters are well written and managed throughout. The makers certainly decided on the fact of challenging the norm when it comes to content creation and creative liberties. They inserted some courageous yet highly debatable affairs into the melodrama of it. Casteism, religion, power, poltics, true face of modern day journalism, relationships, family, friendships, professional workspace, child abuse. This got it all. I have never seen such a series which handles all the above mentioned issued with ease and never brings down the overall quality of the material. Well acted & well narrated execution that definitely makes you concerned about our current whereabouts. Many people might find it offensive and to be honest they absolutely should, others might find it interesting; well it's their own preference as well.

9,6 out of 14 found this helpful,The dark underbelly of crime and plots,msunando,17 May 2020,"Paatal Lok - Delhi police intercept four criminals attempting to assassinate a prominent TV journalist Sanjeev Mehra (Neeraj Kabi) and assign Inspector Hathi Ram Chaudhary (Jaideep Ahlawat) to investigate the plot and frame the charge sheet. To Hathi Ram, this is one huge opportunity that he must grab with all his might to wriggle out of his ignominious existence and progress in his otherwise graceless career. Supported by his assistant, the young and aspiring Ansari (Ishwak Singh), he starts to build the case that seems to involve some strange people - builders, politicians, petty criminals, middlemen and interestingly, the past lives of those four apprehended, going back to their roots. However, a series of bungled moves and judgemental errors throw Hathi Ram off the case and CBI steps in. Almost certain that CBI quickly wanted to wrap up the case to make it look like an international terrorist plot, Hathi Ram continues with his search for the truth and begins to connect the dots, against the wishes of his superiors. What he discovers is actually a muxh wider, sinister plot wherein the assassination of Mehra is a mere decoy that the subject master manipulator has taken an unprecedented advantage of to make his position enviable.Paatal Lok achieves a lot in its first season. It is gripping, has a palpable tension mounting with its progress and underscores a number of topics with an an unpretentious endeavor. The seemingly petty crimes in the dark underbelly of Delhi, their primal connections to other parts of the country, the understated struggles of the minorities, the attitudes towards them and yellow journalism, it tackles all of them with credible sketches. Directors Avinash Arun and Prosit Roy have done a commendable job in balancing the act. Top class performances from Jaideep Ahlawat and Neeraj Kabi are enthusiastically supported by Gul Panag, Ishwak Singh, Niharika Lyra Dutt, Jagjeet Sandhu, Mariembam Ronaldo Singh. But two artists must be lauded for essaying firecracker performances - Swastika Mukherjee as the hypersensitive Dolly Mehra suffering from frequent panic attacks and Abhishek Banerjee as Hathoda Tyagi, the mute kingpin of the assassination plot. It's an unmissable series worthy of binge watching."

Many incidents shown in the series are inspired from real life incidents of last few years. But they are shown from the political perspective of only one section of society or ideology of people. While the truth is they have been proved otherwise either by the courts or facts available. Many scenes show Hindu community in a certain light.

Infact it also made a lot of fun of pseudo secularists who turned out to be the biggest evil for the society.
For ppl who r reviewing this one pls dive in deep to see the layers of society. It actually makes u question everything. This movie has hit the right spot.
If u have such a weak belly for any kind of cricism of any community pls don't watch any movie based on socialism and policial dramas.I think it would be best for you stick to superhero movies.
As for the movie, it had an awesome cast, acting, script had a lot of layers and most importantly it was gripping till the end.
This movie was totally believable and I would recommend it to everyone.
I see a bright future of content from India. After asura which was a bit similar this one would be easily the best I have seen so far from India

It has all components for an cult action packed thriller - amazing storyline, superb direction, outstanding background music, top of the line cinematography, terrific actors. Jaideep acts like he was born for this role. His 'sidekick' Ishwak Singh stands out as Ansari. Neeraj is flawless as expected.

Raw and brutal in its depiction of Core of the middle class /rural setting in India..Truly amazing when merging the cultures and languages.. Feels natural even though almost 4 to 5 languages used throughout.. I guess for us Indians it's normal and does not feel odd anymore. Characters are well developed and actors have done well. Neeraj Soni-Kudos..Many may feel that slight irritation as they crave lack of natural justice at the end, however we need to remember and highlight the teachings displayed so boldly through the course of the story... LGBTQ rights and their unfavourable treatment, making of criminals and society's role in it at large, casteism which drives a majority of power equations and rape culture..all these are prevalent and highlighted front, right and center.Only suggestion: Middle part editing could have been more taut/crisp and could have lead to better product overallKudos to anushka sharma and team for the excellent work."

Does not leave us on a cliff hanger unlike other series in pursuit or rather greed of a second season.

Not the case with this one though.

Best Crime Thriller,ashishsomkuor,24 May 2020,"What a highly dramatic, suspenseful, crime thriller it is...From the starting of the series, when Inspector Hathi Ram introduces the introduction of Patal Lok, to the end of the Swarg Dwaar enlightenment. Fabulous, Outstanding plot, Awesome Acting and Direction and best is the screenplay, how slowly n dramatically the curtains are raised.Wow. This is just one of the best shows we got to see, and best of physchocological crime thriller. It also shows you the dark reality of indian society such as casteism, child molestation, n how rapes are fine in village to teach lesson, n how we are blinded by religious hate, its very very applauding to write and show these dark side of society and make them aware that this is not good, its actually a bad. It depends on society, how to take it whether to change it totally or keep continuing the horror. That is why education should be given to all for free, so that everyone could stand on their own feet n oppose the bad societal practice.
One one note, Patal lok is where we are living right now, and thats what shown here in a brilliant manner. Hats off, a level of series.
10/10 for such great entertainment."

6,5 out of 12 found this helpful,One time watch,abhilashcr,20 May 2020,"Being a RW, my review can be seen as biased but I am sticking with applicable factors of entertainment and neutral viewership.
1. The plot is thick but gives away the suspense very early.
2. Lead actors are superb such as Jaideep, Ishwak, Neeraj, Abhishek, Jagjeet etc.
3. Portrayed the life of a common man of Hindi speaking states, sycophancy in police & politics, maltreatment of ladies & girls in many parts of North India, goon culture, religious enmity. The director has a biased view on religious clashes. Seemingly, the director, writer etc have Nil experience of living in dominant Muslim areas (definitely they have the experience of Muslims in entertainment world)
4. Watch once to experience the immersive acting of Jaideep. Sad that Abhishek got less screen time.
5. Could have rated more if it was not Savitri the dog, affection of Hathoda Tyagi for Dogs & his deliberation, more importantly not able to hold suspense."

His blank and remorseless stare can make you uneasy even at your best moments and send a chill down your spine.His story is often compared with the Demon God Hiranyakashyap, who was blessed by God Brahma himself. Hathoda Tyagi's actions also compel us to make his comparisons with a demon, who has mistakenly taken birth on Earth, so he can torment everyone whom he comes in contact, with an utter lack of empathy.An exemplary performance by an actor who has been known most to play lighter sidekicks of main protagonists in comedy movies.

Surely the best show if you understand its true meaning. Comparable to a hollywood movie. We Indians have become too used to watching the same plot stories and movies (usually one of those salman khan movies where he is always the hero)in theatres. This has spoilt the type of content being produced in India. However this show is a game changer and will surely change the content scenario of India. FInally we get to consume some real cinema and Indian movies can win big at the oscars.

They either think people are too stupid to see through their game or are just too naive to overlook the same. Right for the Caste atrocities to the killing of a person in the name of beef which was later proved false. Yes I agree India is replete with crimes against the Muslim community its equity replete with crimes towards the Hindus.

There are no good or bad guys , they are just people carrying on the legacy or bad circumstances. All actors have done justice to their role. Kudos to the directors for extracting the best from everyone. My congratulations to Anushka Sharma for coming up with this brave series in these very troubled times.

5,2 out of 4 found this helpful,Creativity with bad influence.,ruthu,25 May 2020,"Patal Lok is made with an intention of showing the current situation consisting of injustice, bigotry, castism preaviling amongst the powerful and privileged people in Northern part of India. But the actual image it gives is that the place is almost unlivable. It tries to defend the crimes committed by people due to acquiring their beastly nature from facing torture and humiliation. The violence shown in the show is very crude and definitely gives nerves and triggers few bad emotions. Even though the character performances are brilliant and screenplay is mind-blowing the overall experience will slightly be bitter since it portrays the society we live in as a a notorious, apathetic and cruel towards the unprivileged. Even though some parts of it may show cruelty against minor sections of the society for example a transgender was beataen brutally by a police officer for no mistake of her and child abuse which is also much existing in our society. Watch Patal Lok only if you are a person who just takes movies for the moment and dont get influenced by it. I would suggest you too avoid if you are emotionally vulnerable to movies and get impacted easily."

Beautifully captured by competent directors, the storyline goes deep into the integral flaws of humans. So much so that, at one point in time, you find the dogs in the show better than the humans.If you let the first two episodes by, and try and absorb the tone of this pitch dark thriller, you would see what all it unearths. There is a brutal take on communal violence, castism... Many times in the story I felt so safe being in the neighborhood that I live in as the one which we don't know and the one which gets showcased here is totally a harsh environment.As a police procedural drama too , it is clinical.There are certain characters although not thoroughly admirable, nonetheless are so succinctly created and even more beautifully portrayed. I especially liked the characters of Hathi Ram and his young protege. The juxtaposition of different religions and how inadvertently, we treat others who are not like us, is so deftly portrayed.Jaideep Ahlawat is just too good. If you felt Saif was awesome in Sacred Games , but Manoj Bajpayee outplayed Saif with his brand of cop... Then you must watch Ahlawat.. for me his performance is just right there with Manoj Bajpayee's performance in The Family Man.Give it a go as it surely doesn't disappoint."

The side plots are well knitted into the main story arc, and the characters feel organic. Dialogues don't feel forced. Themes of crime and social degeneration are well depicted.

Well a crime is a part of every culture and you cannot imagine a society without this factor,atleast in india. Patal lok shows exceptional screen writing,a very true and dirty nature of white collars and there need for the criminals. I may sound over ambitious but this series is better than money heist,breaking bad in case of every minute aspect. The acting is top notch,specially ahlawat sir...Hatts off. All charectors in each and every part are fine tuned to perfection. The directorial duo done a fabulous job by handling this epic story in a very daring manner. It needs guts to carry the whole 9 parts story without any big names from the industry. I am very happy and also very confident that this crew will come with more surprises in future.

In just 10 minutes of episode 1, you will get why it is named pataal lok. Story takes a slow gripping in episode 1 , and gets fast in 2nd and 3rd, it gets a little lengthy in middle where I had to use skip button. But again it takes charge with a shock and twist.Gem in this series is casting, it's perfectly done. No other actors could have replaced these. As usual Jaideep Ahalawat and Abhishek Banerjee make audience fall in love with their character once again. Jaideep's character Hathiram is very well written, you will get sticked to his story, and might think you know this man in real life. Bond between hathi ram and imran ansari is heart touching. Back Story behind every criminal is well portrayed, you can't complain. we get to see a powerful performances through this.Politics and dark human behaviour is also a plus point in series. It keeps you thrilled for some scenes. As you think and try to predict the story it suddenly changes the game and gets away with some surprise.The story gets really intense at start, and gives a good suspense. During whole season I was thinking something big is going to happen and will blow mind, well it happened but didn't affected that much. I was hoping for better than that.If you are wondering what to watch, I will definitely suggest this, it's good. And must watch for Performances."

For someone who loves dark crime drama and believe that Indian productions have not been working on that, we have something here to be amazed about. What this show offers you is a chance to empathize with the darkest stories of sad cornered lives of few characters who represent the most unfortunate ones from a population of a billion people.
It is definitely not a show for everyone. Not for people who wants to debate about its political representations. Its for people who enjoys shows like True Detective, The Sinner etc.
There is a heavy amount of pyscho dramatization of characters which is supported by most of their performances.
There is no over-glorification of characters like in gangster shows such as Mirzapur or Sacred Games to get you excited about, the protagonist represents a simple police man who is just trying to not make any errors.
I would recommend this show to anyone who is specifically in to this genre. Please do not watch if you are not, you would not like it and you would cry about it, for all those pleas,e continue watching something commercial.
It is a work of fiction, and there is no agenda."

Yes I felt that left leaning ideology in the under current of the narrative. However, all was very subtle though it packed a punch.
The character of Tyagi didn't have much dialogue but the soul piercing stare would give you goosebumps.
The episode of Cheeni's backstory was the hardest to watch. I felt something die inside me.

There can be hits like Mirzapur / Sacred Games etc but this one makes you think, it makes you just use your own brain, smartness, intelligence to unravel the mystery.It makes you feel the pain some people from our own country have to go through since their childhood days.It makes you hate our society too who makes innocent people convert to criminals due to the society's misjudgement, mockery, bullying, personal hunger etc. etc.Enough can't be said of the perfect writing, casting, direction and acting in this series.This is what should come out of the talent from the industry we have.
As most of the movies coming out from the hindi industry are just for commercial success but not to do some good to the society or to give a wake up call to the blindfolded public (the percentage of which is growing nowadays). They do nothing more than to earn money for the producers.More series like Paatal Lok and movies like Dhadak, Article 15 should come out as I support such creations which highlight the wrongdoings in our society and make them clearly visible to the public to show them what's right and what's wrong, to show them who's right and who's wrong.Must watch definitely. I hope these talented teams of directors, script writers, actors bring more of these.Covers almost everything, every evil thing like Fake news (you can guess the names of big top shot media journalists who shout and spread fake breaking news to capture TRPs just to earn money.. once you complete the series you can easily guess), then land disputes, child abuse, women used as objects of revenge, honest/dishonest journalists, honest/dishonest cops, extramarital affairs, most importantly bad Politicians creating everything bad in the system from head to tail.So I just want to appreciate Amazon Prime to bring in such quality series in their bucket for the viewers. Keep up the great work and hope to see such more in future.
Thanks for reading and you can give a like/helpful if you really liked my review..."

10,4 out of 12 found this helpful,Do Not trust these 1/10 reviews,namanpuri-87379,20 May 2020,"This series is just mind blowing. Not even a second is wasted in the entire series. Excellent acting by each and every actor. Every character is so well portrayed that you will really empathize with them, even the smallest characters. The story is just so raw and it plucks the right heart stringes .
This 9 episode series chose some very controversial topics which you can see by reading other reviews. I strongly disagree with that point of view. But its like Kabir Singh for feminists. Either you enjoy it or you spoil all the fun by worthlessly reading into things.
The story has a background of most characters having a troubled childhood and being oppressed at the hands of upper caste or different monsters, so the argument that they show Hindus in a bad light is wrong because this stuff does happen. Even now.
It is a story. Not everyone is trying to defame Hindus. Enjoy this masterpiece without making it communal.On final note, I thought this series was better than Sacred Games ,Mirzapur, Apharan, Rangbaaz, The Family Man, Bard of blood. Honestly the best series I have seen in this genre."

The show tries to tell us that blindly following one faith doesn't give you a right to mercilessly beat and kill people of other faiths.
The atmosphere, the acting (Haathiraam is our true everyday hero, hands down), the thrill, the uneasiness, the brutality - everything is pitch perfect here.
The one exchange between haathiram and his wife single-handedly destroys the theme of Kabir singh and Thappad, really enjoyed that.

When I say plot, i mean a one-liner like 4 criminals captured alive while trying to murder leading journalist of the country. But when they developed this into a full storyline, it became too weak, feeble and wasted. The whole pieces when put-together gives you a make-believe story and plot which fails big time.The makers have tried to slip-in and sell a propaganda. Some of the cliche scenes which you would have seen in some of the so called leftists film maker's product related to riots and communal tension.

The series drags in parts and there's flashes of brilliance, and you kind of wait to see where this is all headed - nowhere outstanding.Point to note - excessive violence, cussing, nudity etc does not an impactful series make. Be original and you can do a lot more with less of the above. It felt that most of the language and violence were mostly for shock effect. Also there were many scenes especially when the characters attempt to convey emotions in English that appear stilted, artificial and awkward.Casting wise, Jaideep is brilliant. The others are equally brilliant. However, Gul Panag could never act, and she still can't. A few of the child artistes showed much more promise.At the most pretty average stuff - you would have seen many of the scenes, heard similar dialogues, camera angles etc. In average Western series.Underworld series are now kind of overdone.

How were dangerous criminals arrested without any handcuffs put on them?Hathi Ram lost his main notebook and he never noticed it missing, until it was shown to him by a journalist who had taken it.
He notices the chaiwala glaring at Cheeni and she at him and does not take any action on that.
These are just a few examples.
The makers should have paid much keener attention to the details and not allow an excellent script to have so many holes.The acting by almost everyone was competent with the standouts being Hathi Ram and Tyagi.Gul Panang was totally wasted in the home as her role had no substance whatsoever.

CBI is basically diapar cleaner of Government.
Journalism is all about TRP.

The main protagonist is an awesome actor but in my opinion the screenplay of this series is weak. It doesn't explore it's antagonist or some other cast members storyline much.
I think they were not able to put everything together in the way they should have.
The climax was also not good.
You will keep on waiting and waiting for some surprise in the series but you will be kept waiting.
It's an average series."

The main actor was brilliant.To be honest there was not a weak actor in the series.The main police officer was not the standard leading man, he was flawed, made errors of judgement, etc, but that added to the realism and made you engage with him as a character.The story has a darkness, which does not hold back with the gore and violence. It touches on wealth, religion, caste, the big city and the regions of India. If there was a second season it would be definitely on my list.
I would note that I do not speak Hindi and watches this show using the subtitles."

It highlights the weak situation of the poor/ lower class are still into. Tough actions they are forced to take which are definitely incorrect but morality is not a choice. The real issues of sexual abuse, robbery, casteism, hatefulness, violence and deadly revenge, the divide between the rich and poor.Though true, I hated it when DCP Bhagat in the last episode says System will never change, only the people who do not perform their roles assigned will get replaced. It's a shame of what a society we have created after so many years of evolutionary process gone into. Power and the lust for Power in the hands of few making them do stuff taking the society into ""Paatal Lok"". Even the highly reputed organisation like Police Force, CBI or it could have been any other institute dance to their tunes. In any given society if we can eradicate the creation of Paatal Lok then only we as a group of people will come up as winners.Finally I would say that good karma/ deeds always brings good results as we saw in case of love and care of the stray dogs saved life.Kudos to the team and congratulations on their success! Direction and casting was spot on. I hope there are much more audience to this as at least we have moved positively in content creation."
9,1 out of 2 found this helpful,Brilliantly written and executed. Jaideep Ahlawat was tailor made for this.,suhalkapranay,25 May 2020,"Very difficult to make a crime thriller with such perfection and realism. The story arc takes a complete circle and executed brilliantly. There were instances which made me in awe of the sheer audacity of the writers yet unheard of in India's entertainment space.
The characters are well written with realistic and intriguing background. You get an understanding of where these characters come from which is brand new perspective on them.
One thing that stands out in this series is the way that sensitive issues like child trafficking, caste dynamics in rural India takes place which most writers don't address as they deem it too controversial or don't find it worth their time. The series deals with a lot of social injustice and practices prevailing in the lower sections of society which is largely unheard of among the privileged ones and hence is rightly called 'paatal lok.
As for people deeming it Anti-hindu, I, personally did not find it to be that. In fact it gives a few references of Mahabharat and how they still hold true in today's time which tells us how timeless these great legends are.
Talking about performances Jaideep Ahlawat stands out in the series with his brilliant portrayal of an underachieving cop tired of taking orders from people who worked under him once and is now desperate to prove himself.
Neeraj Kabi, in my view, was an opportunity wasted. He is a decent actor and could have done more with the role. All other actors justify the roles and execute them satisfactorily.
All in all its a whole new type of crime thriller in the underbellies of modern India."

5,1 out of 2 found this helpful,Mediocore; Overhyped,siddhass,24 May 2020,"The acting was pretty darn good and the story was pretty addictive. Until episode number 6. Wherein the series was rushed to reach an end. The plot itself didnt have a lot to it, it was simple; it worked due to how its wrote. But it went downhill really quickly.
The backstory of Tyagi is kind of lame, like if you are showing a psychopath you have to do it in a slight more better way. The entire thing related to dogs seemed lazy and showed the scriptwriters couldn't get a prominent backstory.
The show's effort to show social commentary is appreciable and it does show the dark side of our society, which we often ignore.. the show is or atleast tries to keep itself grounded in reality. However there was propaganda, in here, which just seems to be exaggerated. I appreciate their attempts to convey a social message but it was clearly over-exaggerated and made to go along with the script. Honestly directors need to ditch the entire propaganda based web series they are pumping out.. I'm sick of it.
Overall -
Script- 4/10 (Cliche)
Acting- 9.5/10 (Jaideep was awesome)
Pacing- 5.5/10
Cinematography- 7/10

10,1 out of 2 found this helpful,"Not a single thing is out of place, everything has layered meaning!",irfanangel,24 May 2020,"""Paatal Lok"" is probably the best Indian Series you can watch. It sneaks into its plot everything that is wrong with India: caste-based violence, discrimination on the basis of religion, muslim lynchings by Cow vigilantes... and all this doesn't make its plot laboriously boring but adds to its edge-of-the-seat material. Much better than meandering ""Sacred Games"" and Amazon Prime does a better job than its previous best ""Mirzapur""."

10,2 out of 7 found this helpful,Hell Yeah,Thechocolateboy,23 May 2020,"Paatal Lok is surprisingly an oddball in the middle of a fair of typical crime mystery thrillers that baits a worm at the last to make a new season. Yes, it's apparently complete in itself; at least let's the viewers to sleep at night, but not sure if on an optimistic note.
Comparing Paatal Lok with Sacred Games or Mirzapur is rather misguiding ; it is totally different from those, both from magnitude to temperament. As the name suggests, the show delves into the deep of our system; which is corrupted from the root hence, can not be reformed.Hathi Ram Chaudhary (Jaideep Ahlawat), a middle class cynical police officer, having nothing but failure in life, gets a very high profile case when apparently four murderers are caught red handed attempting a murder of Sanjeev Mehra( Neeraj Kabi), a news tycoon. When he investigates deeper, he founds more than what he barely imagined. Jaideep gave his all to do justice to his character. Neeraj Kabi is always in form, Abhishek Banerjee needs a serious mention, and others too, did good job.Mysteriously dark, the show is a real stunner; especially when it shows the pasts of four of the captives - equally astonishing and eye opener about real India. So real, so touching, so gruesome and so undeniable truth. From politics to underworld to business policy to religious intolerance to sexual assault to child abuse - every part is touched and touched with care. This Anushka Sharma produced show is my current favourite with a serious direction by Avinash-Prasith. Kudos to the four writers especially Sudip Sharma. The show is really worth a binge watching and then gives a scope to think about it for the rest of the time. Though, overall it also gives opportunity to give a new season to answer the fate of the two captives ."

Though the plot highlights the dark realities of our society, the liberal propaganda showing Muslims as innocents and victims of cruelty from the Hindu majority is repeated in every possible way and is clearly visible.
The storyline has some major mistakes, like when the case is handed over to the CBI how the details of the suicide of Tarik were not passed, and how Hathiram didn't remember the lost diary for days in which he wrote notes from the case.Disappointed, I wish we could get a political-crime web series with balanced views."

Ahlawat is a good actor but he is impression less here. Nothing new in story, we have seen already for lot of times. Makers supposing that they could not make series without police, criminals and abusive words now a days as there are no any subjects existing. Mentionable thing is that sound quality so poor that even on high volume I could not understand pronunciations and trust me I had to enable subtitles to go through series. Another objectionable thing is that they used very abusive words about a particular community. It is shameful thing and God saves us from seeing another series of such garbage. Not for recommendation, you can avoid else will find waste of time and nothing come out."

The worst part is its abusive language, Adult scenes, Nudity which all seem forced and unnecessary. Though the screenplay and Performances are pretty great whereas the storyline has nothing special to offer. There's Less Crime and more Drama.

Talking about the series, I have seen the best casting in this series compared to recent shows, Main lead is from Haryana, Actor portrayed as Killer from Punjab is from Punjab etc. that adds up to that there are no fake accent, like in lot of Bollywood movies. Its good to see good actors are given lead instead of 'good looking actors'."

6,1 out of 5 found this helpful,Great acting...story had great potential but key plot issues and final discoveries end up disappointing a bit,moviepiglet,20 May 2020,"There's a lot of hype about this show, and no doubt it was great entertainment with some excellent acting with a gripping, intense vibe that keeps you going till the end. However, all the overall hype cannot make up for several issues:1. The trivialization of CBI's findings and absolutely no repercussions of their accusations is very hard to believe. They blame ISI / Pakistan for the murder attempt, and then we hear nothing else about this for the rest of the show until the end. How would Pakistan ever not respond to such an accusation? How can the CBI just spin a terrorist story as a cover up for some UP politics?
2. The bigger problem with the story is that it builds a very larger than life expectations with regards to the main story - who is Masterji? why did Tyagi want to kill Sanjeev Mehra? why did he not? And the answers in the end, are just, well, quite underwhelming. Masterji has been dead for a while. And the entire story revolves around a political play between Bajpayee and Gujjar. Sanjeev Mehra actually has NOTHING to do with the entire plot even though that's the issue being pursued throughout. And the big question of why he was not killed? because of a dog... I love dogs, and it's a cute thing to add in the story, but for it to be one of the grand revelations...no..Still a great watch. It's awesome to see more and more cinema of this type being produced in India, and compared to the usual Bollywood trash this is Oscar worthy, but such shows have to be held to a much higher standard, and so a 6/10"
6,1 out of 5 found this helpful,Okayish Drama Marketed Good,rgaur-12103,18 May 2020,"Paatal Lok is an okayish but well marketed TV Series. The story is good but it doesn't hold you by the edge and the urge to binge watch it. Every episode feels independent of the previous. Almost everything connects at the end in the last few mins of the episode. The journey of the entire story feels like you are travelling on a village road.1. The story highlights the point of how a simple man is played by a political system which is corrupt at so many levels.2. There are a lot of assumptions in the climax. Hathoda Tyagi is assumed as a serial killer who only kills bad guys (The part where they say that Tyagi felt that Sanjeev is a good guy and wanted a confirmation to kill. This is nowhere mentioned during his introduction. Infact, he is shown as a ruthless killer).3. There is only one good dialogue in the entire series.Overall, I felt like series is just one time watch with no big expectations as marketed by the team."

Jaideep Ahlawat steals the show in Paatal lok, he's the heart & soul of this gritty crime thriller. This show gives a certain vibe we get to see in Anurag Kashyap's works mostly. It's unapologetic & hits you in the gut.
The plot is quite simple, it involves corrupt cops, gangsters & polititions. But the uniqueness lies in the storytelling & direction aspect. Paatal lok isn't flawless, it has some loop holes here & there. But overall it's a must watch crime thriller.
Neeraj Kabi is a revelation here, the rest of the supporting cast did a phenomenal job as well. We need more good contents like this on OTT platforms."

People saying this to be a propaganda are absolutely paranoid, it has religious conflicts of all types, and doesn't bash one religion. Language is strong and it stings, some scenes are rather uncomfortable but that brings a flavor of originality in this brilliant piece of work.The cast is perhaps biggest strength of this series. Especially the police and goons, reminded me of Paan Singh Tomar. Scenes and conversation during news scenes seems rather fabricated and contrived to a degree but one can withstand this for the show is great!"

Though an attempt can be seen to cash in on resonating it with mythology, the series could stand completely independent of the minor mythological resemblance.
There is a lot of resemblance in the storyline about the current socio-political atmosphere, journalist getting death threats just being one of them.
The only unconvincing part of the whole story is the reason why Hathoda Tyagi (Abhishek Banerjee) doesn't kill Sanjeev Mehra. This bit of the story seemed to be a case of slothful writing. Tying this end somehow could have made the end more convincing. But this shouldn't be the reason to not watch this series."

8,0 out of 3 found this helpful,Finally a well made Indian Series coming out from Amazon Prime.,surajpnair,24 May 2020,"Breathe, Family Man, Panchayat are the Amazon Prime web series I have watched that left me disappointed for all the missed opportunities it had when it comes to the overall content and especially the presentation of it. But, Paatal Lok manages to break this jinx for me, and this could be the game-changer for Amazon Prime producing Indian content.Paatal Lok is about the 'divides' humans created in all forms and this series smartly does not take a stand, rather it presents a perspective that is quite justifying to an extent, even though we as an audience feel pity for our existence, our survival to stay ahead in the game for power, supremacy.The external conflict of the series is driven through an investigative thriller mode wherein 4 suspects are arrested in an attempt to kill the country's celebrated media icon. The internal conflict is rather more fascinating wherein the characters involved directly or indirectly in this incident have their own brutal stories layered on humiliation, racism, casteism, patriarchal supremacy.The series starts with the underline statement from the protagonist Hathiram Choudhary defining the three divided worlds - Heaven (Svarga), Earth (Bhoomi) & Hell (Paatal Lok) and it is the Paatal Lok wherein the majority of fewer privilege lives gets stranded, tortured and nullified. The protagonist who eventually is investigating this sensational incident is bullied by his superiors, underestimated by his seniors depicting how the society is so ruthless when it comes to people having power using it against the less privileged so conveniently.Cleverly, there are many social myths busted on topics related to a specific religion, caste, race, sex and that's where the series stands out on its own even though there is a strong thread of investigation running on the forefront.The making is quite impressive, the plots, the subplots, the characters, the dramatics, the narrative - almost everything very well thought of. The casting is very interesting and we see one of the country's underutilized talent driving the narrative with extreme ease. From the cast, I was very much impressed by Jaideep Ahlawat playing Hathiram and Swastika Mukherjee playing Dolly and the remaining ensemble cast was too good.There are some loose ends when it comes to the pacing of the narrative, and there are few side characters lacking depth and felt they were introduced just to arrive conveniently at the climax of the investigative journey. The perspectives from the four suspects after their arrest was not delved at all, not sure whether this will be picked up in the upcoming seasons, but this aspect definitely felt left out in the proceedings.Lastly, there are many instances referring to the dog, and the loyalty it posses. The end of the investigation plot touched upon the reference of a dog from one of the Indian mythologies ending it in style. Neatly done!Paatal Lok in a nutshell - Heavenly writing serving as the strongest pillar to this great web series. Highly Recommended!"

9,0 out of 4 found this helpful,Paatal Lok- Your Gateway To Heaven,nagsaptarshi,23 May 2020,"'Paatal Lok' is a complex, layered, multidimensional, and hard-hitting political saga of greed, ambition, degradation of values and redemption. This is an adaptation of the defamed journalist Tarun Tejpal's book 'The Story of My Assassins' but the creators nowhere in the show mention his name, maybe because he has been charged for sexually assaulting a colleague. The show explores the dark sides of human nature and forays into a world hitherto kept away from the Indian viewers considering them immature to face the truth and live in a utopian world. It explicitly demonstrates the state of affairs of right-wing activism, the hypocrisy of the left-liberals, and the status of the machinery controlled by the state. From the degradation of values on the world of journalism over the last decade or so to the way how minorities are treated in this country to how we fail to empathize with the LGBT community, 'Patal Lok' is a dark commentary about every bleak side of a country torn between lofty ideals and nasty realities. How an institution like CBI makes a mockery of investigation under pressure from those in power and use the clichéd weapon of ISI, terrorism to shield the criminals adorned with portfolios, respect and luxury to an extent of vulgarity have been depicted with sheer truthfulness sans any emotions otherwise banal in the hotchpotch of a Bollywood potboiler. There are violence, gore, real-life obscenities to an extent that you may look away from the screen. But this is it, guys. Welcome to the real world.The script by Sudip Sharma is gripping and even though I sat with a microscope to find an error, it was hard to find any. All the loose ends have been filled in with fitting conclusions. The dialogue right from the start is the hallmark of the show. ""It is written in the scriptures but I have read it in WhatsApp"" epitomizes the present generation intolerance and fake news manufacturing without any proficiency or penchant for factuality. Do not miss a single dialogue of the entire show as it is laden with such brilliant one-liners. The Director duo of Prosit Roy and Avinash Arun does a marvelous job of harmonizing conflicting ideas and bringing those under a slick narrative.""Paatal Lok"" gifts us one of the most promising actors of recent times, Jaideep Ahlawat who finally bags a role that matches his acting stature. He is the protagonist and the world is shown through his eyes. He is often torn between his professional and personal turmoil and ends up being a loser in front of everyone, his family, co-worker, bosses, and society. How an ordinary cop with a conscience faces hardships every day and yet ends up gaining the worthless guy tag has been portrayed so efficiently through Jaideep's character Hathi Ram Chowdhury. Finally Indian movie makers have learned to show the vulnerabilities of the police minus the imaginary glamour shown in the third grade Bollywood movies like Singham or Dabaang. Neeraj Kabi as the shrewd journalist who is living a dual life- a life of falsehood in the realms of mundanity and a life of the fake ideologies of a liberal champion in front of the camera is restrained and genuine to the script. Abhishek Banerjee as the fearsome Hammer Tyagi steals the show with his bleak, ice-cold expressions. Every other character has done justice to their roles however minute those are. The review will be incomplete without talking about the sincerity of Ishwak Singh as the amiable cop and IPS aspirant Ansari and Swastika Mukherjee as the dog loving, soft spoken spouse of journalist Sanjeev Mehra. Practically every dark character in the movie has some bright sides in their characters and every so called righteous characters have their side of vulnerabilities. It is this balance that strikes the cord in this gruesome show of greed, lust and inner pathos.
Finally, a big salute to bollywood's glam doll Anushka Sharma for taking a path less trodden. From NH10 to Pari, from Philauri to Paatal Lok, she is doing an appreciable job of bringing raw yet immensely talented crew together as a producer. The saffron brigade has already shunned Deepika. Now they are slamming Patal Lok as a Hindu-phobic work. How far will they go is now a matter of conjecture as Anushka's name is related with the biggest vote bank of the country - Virat Kohli."

7,0 out of 5 found this helpful,Definitely better than Mirzapur.,TheDennisBergkampFan,23 May 2020,"If Indian television is looking for it's Breaking Bad, I would say that we are somewhere in Dexter territory at the moment. It would not be hard to draw parallels with Dexter. Starts of well and fizzles out towards the end just like Dexter. The acting all around is of the highest order. The amount of gore would make Dexter himself cringe. The moments between Sanjeev Mehra and his wife reminds one of the treadmill scene with Dexter's son.Paatal Lok in my opinion is a far superior show to Mirzapur. Paatal Lok has a lot of things that work for it and first and foremost is the excellent cast. The cast in my opinion can be divided into the English speaking cast and the Hindi speaking cast and the latter tower over the former.I know of people who have not watched Breaking Bad because they could not put up with the Walter-Skylar drama in the early seasons. The Sanjeev - Dolly drama is atleast ten times worse than that. Sanjeev Mehra""s wife is like Brody's daughter in Homeland.There were also some minor roles that were cast brilliantly. Special mention to the lady who plays the constable Manju and the bloke who plays Raju Bhaiyya. The bloke who plays Hathi Ram Choudhary is an excellent casting. India should have its own version of the Emmy's to recognize talent on the small screen. Not those nincompoops from shows like Baalika Vadhu and Kahaani Ghar Ghar ki. The genuine actors and India has a plethora of them at the moment.The ' Vicky please' guy from Stree is a fantastic actor but I am honestly not sure about his casting in negative roles. It's hard to look past his funny face.The storyline is intriguing enough to keep you riveted but it sort of fizzles out with a rather bland ending. Definitely better than Mirzapur. Definitely worth a watch. Still a long long way to go before we have our own Breaking Bad."

It even addressed various social issues and related it to the life of characters very well. The plot build up was a bit slow but each and every episodes were suspenseful. Talking about the cast, Jaideep Ahlawat was at his best as Hathi Ram Chaudhary , Neeraj Kabi and Abhishek Banerjee did a great job as well playing Sanjeev Mehra and Vishal Tyagi, respectively."

Still, it is a decent effort and is better than many other Indian web series out there. Story is fantastic (dunno why many are criticizing it..). Direction is slow and hence seems lengthy at times. Jaydeep Ahlawat is brilliant, however female casting is not good.
Few communist issues have been tested but not explored deeply which makes it rather hollow. Overall, a good Indian web series to watch after Asur."

8,0 out of 2 found this helpful,A decent watch,naveenumashankar,22 May 2020,"Not a very great series coming from the director of drishyam. It seems like a very simple/straight narration about a failed cop trying to make it big, until the penultimate episode. However, some revelations in the final episode saves the plot.
Character arcs are one of the major postive. Director has done a great job in designing the character arcs of all the main leads. Every character has a backstory on why he is doing what he is doing.
It is close to reality and shows that even if you get to the heart of the case and understand everything about the system, corruption, politics and underworld involved in a particular case, you can't be a hero and save the day for everyone. There's only so much that you can do. Director has succeeded in showing that the protagonist is not a hero who brings justice to everyone, he is just an ordinary cop who did some extraordinary investigation in this case.I see a lot of reviews naming it as hinduphobic, it definitely doesn't seem so. It just shows the reality of what's happening in our country. Whoever is feeling offended should ask themself if they feel the same way when the religion of the terrorist is always muslim in most of Indian movies. You'll have your answer.Final word: I am not in awe of this tv series, but it certainly didn't waste my time too. A decent watch."
9,0 out of 3 found this helpful,Wow! This ain't just another crime drama!,yagnikmehul,22 May 2020,This is great story telling accompnied by sharp picturisation and high class acting. The story just goes deeper layer by layer aa it progresses with tight grip. There are references to so many deep routed issues of society and at times it's heart touching. These are same realities of society which most of us know but we choose to ignore. All the lead actors have been perfectly cast and they all do justice. Abhishek Banerjee definitely steals the show with his raw expressions. I cut one point as I felt bit drag near emd. It would have been perfect with one episode less. But must watch.

Review :
paatal lok a one time watchable to feel the darkest zone of our society and may be a reality known/unknown to many of us. weak story line the series is not able to hold interest.
I think Audiences are evolving now and they are looking for a good content only. A series will definitely do a good business if there's a good story telling. Every actor has given their best.
But its one time watch Entertainment.

7,0 out of 10 found this helpful,Well crafted plot with no so great end.,shashankpatel-37369,21 May 2020,"It starts with a conspiracy of some brutal gangsters, high profile politicians, and some policemen leads to this journey where investigation goes to a stubborn and not so successful policemen who tries everything he can to find the truth. It involves an attempt of killing of a high profile journalist, It starts with a very high note and keeps the momentum going, where it gets reveled that story isn't about what it looks like. It gets you glued to the seat until the last two episodes where the ending was crafted so abruptly and the suspense wasn't reveled in an ideal way. It would have been an excellent plot if that was ideal otherwise turned out to be an above average for sure. Acting has been punch of the whole plot."

7,0 out of 4 found this helpful,Gripping screenplay but messaging distracted plot,rajiv-chavda,17 May 2020,"It is a much better story telling and tight screenplay than many of the recent web series from India.
+ Positive points:
Tyagi, Ansari and Hathi ram were excellent in their part. Even supporting cast were good.Good thing about series, there were no stars.The screenplay was tight and didn't let your lose interest despite unnecessary messaging in between.Mystery around Master-ji was intriguing.Confronting the rich class's moral who behaves they are above everything.+ Negatives
This is no Delhi crimes which was crisp, up to the point and thrilling.Messaging about majority targeting innocent minorities (without showing significant context).Few occurrences shouldn't be put in just to get more eyeballs.All is all, it is a worth watch, just don't think this is the best series India has ever produced."

7,0 out of 3 found this helpful,Pros & Cons of this largely good show,arastuz,15 May 2020,"Just binged on entire Paatal Lok today. My family and I sat through 400 minutes+ non-stop. My Mom didn't even go for her walk for the first time in a long time, which is a testament to how engaging it was.Not really a review but some points come to mind.Pros:1. Politically progressive and bold. Potshots at patriarchy, Arnab, communalism, right-wing politics, capitalism, nationalism etc. Good and rare to see OTTs continuing to be unfailingly left of Center.2. Largely realistic and gripping writing and direction3. The character, character-development and performance by the protagonist - Jaideep Ahlawat4. Also, performances by Vipin Sharma, Neeraj Kabi, Abhishek Banerjee, Ishwak Singh. And the surprise casting of Anup Jalota.5. Engaging, largely not unnecessary subplots and backstories. Including the symbolism of dogs.Cons:1. By the time you get to the end, you feel cheated of having spent so much time on following Neeraj Kabi and his wife's stories. Although not unbelievable, you wish they'd have found a stronger core rationale for the plot.2. The character whose killing the whole plot supposedly revolves around, is weak, underdeveloped and one you never root for. Hence after a point you don't care much about him.3. Too much screentime to the subplot involving Neeraj Kabi's wife - Swastika Mukherjee - that doesn't advance the core story at all.4. Once the initial investigations and character expositions are done, the rest really drags. The show could at least have been edited into 2-3 episodes lesser. It's actually not very binge-friendly, last 2-3 episodes, you keep shifting in your seat.5. Some directorial liberties that are convenient but break the realism6. Nearly everyone in this world is horribly bad, dark, violent and abusive. There is a difference between realism and voyeurism.7. Some gruesome violence and rape8. The casting of Gul Panag is completely inappropriate9. The shifting of political loyalties in the last episode is confusing and not comprehensible.10. The antagonists sparing the protagonists is completely unbelievable and jarringly breaks the realism.Overall, among the really good Indian originals. Recommended but not with expectations of greatness."
